# What is Ollama

Ollama is an open-source project that serves as a powerful and user-friendly platform for running LLMs on your local machine. It acts as a bridge between the complexities of LLM technology and the desire for an accessible and customizable AI experience.

At its core, Ollama simplifies the process of downloading, installing, and interacting with a wide range of LLMs, empowering users to explore their capabilities without the need for extensive technical expertise or reliance on cloud-based platforms.
