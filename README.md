### What is GGUF and GGML?

**Note:** GGML officially phased out, new format called GGUF

GGUF and GGML are file formats used for storing models for inference, especially in the context of language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Let’s explore the key differences, pros, and cons of each.

GGML (GPT-Generated Model Language): Developed by Georgi Gerganov, GGML is a tensor library designed for machine learning, facilitating large models and high performance on various hardware, including Apple Silicon.

GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format), introduced as a successor to GGML (GPT-Generated Model Language), was released on the 21st of August, 2023. This format represents a significant step forward in the field of language model file formats, facilitating enhanced storage and processing of large language models like GPT.

Developed by contributors from the AI community, including Georgi Gerganov, the creator of GGML, GGUF’s creation aligns with the needs of large-scale AI models, though it appears to be an independent effort. Its use in contexts involving Facebook’s (Meta’s) LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) models underscores its importance in the AI landscape.
