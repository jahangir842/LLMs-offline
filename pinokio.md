# Pinokio
Pinokio is a browser that lets you install, run, and programmatically control ANY application, automatically. It is a project that simplifies running large language models (LLMs) on your local machine by providing a user-friendly interface and pre-configured settings. It leverages popular libraries and frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch to make it easier for users to interact with and run various LLMs without needing extensive knowledge of the underlying technologies.

Pinokio is a self-contained platform that lets you install apps in an isolated manner.

**Isolated Environment:** no need to worry about messing up your global system configurations and environments

**Batteries Included:** no need to manually install required programs just to install something (such as ffpeg, node.js, visual studio, conda, python, pip, etc.). Pinokio takes care of it automatically.

### Key Features of Pinokio

1. **Simplified Setup**: Pinokio offers a straightforward setup process, making it accessible to users who may not be familiar with the complexities of installing and configuring LLMs.

2. **Pre-configured Environments**: It provides pre-configured environments for running different LLMs, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility.

3. **User-friendly Interface**: Pinokio includes a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) to manage and run models easily.

4. **Support for Multiple Models**: It supports various models from the Hugging Face Transformers library and can be extended to support additional models.
